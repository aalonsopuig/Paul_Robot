Instructions

This is a work in progress, files might change until it is finished. 
Before printing read all this, since the updates are on the bottom, it might save you printing time. 
In order to protect this Open Source project, I uploaded the rest of the skull on: 
https://cubehero.com/physibles/hairygael/Skull_for_Robot_InMoov

Print one of each STL files attached. I did it in ABS. 
Normally there is no need for support. 
There is pre-supports to be removed: 
On "TopMouth", under the noze and also inside there is anti wobbling leg to remove. 
On "SideHear" there is anti wobbling legs to remove + a joining junction. 
On "EyeGlass" remove the eyes supports.

The assembly is pretty simple, you need to glue together "TopMouth" to "SideHear"; The other parts can be screwed attached to each other or to the structure.
