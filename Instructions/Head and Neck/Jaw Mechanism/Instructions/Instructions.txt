Instructions

Print one of each STL. 
No support needed, the "JawV3", might have a bit of overhang on the inside. 
"JawV3" have pre-support added to be removed after printing. 
Print most parts with a 0.5 layer thickness, best with no raft, 30% infill. 
Print JawHingeV1 and JawpistonV1 with a 0.25 layer thickness, full infill.

This jaw mechanism is to be assembled with this:

Update 10/03/13 I have modified a little bit the pre-support of "JawV2" to "JawV3". This will ease to remove it from the printed part. 
Modified also "JawHolderV1" to JawHolderV2" this allows easy mounting on "FaceHolderV3" (neck assembly) 
Update 18/1013 I resurfaced Jaw to get a less faceted mesh. JawV3 to Jaw V4.
